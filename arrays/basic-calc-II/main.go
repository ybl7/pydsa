// Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value.
// The integer division should truncate toward zero.
// You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].
// Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().
// 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
// s consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by some number of spaces.
// s represents a valid expression.
// All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 231 - 1].
// The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

// Suppose we have some expression like a op1 b op2 c, where a, b, and c are numbers and op1, and op2 are operators
// Let's not some obvious facts that we might gloss over day to day
// 1) operators operate on 2 operands (in this question at least)
// 2) numbers involved in the same operation can at most be separated by one operator, i.e. numbers involved in the #
//	  same operation are adjacent, you can't have a being operated with c, as in our example above
// 3) operators have a different priority, but like numbers, you only need to consider any two at a time, either op1
//	  has greater priority than op2 or the other way round, there is no need to get any other operators involved
// 4) to know the correct order of operations for some number between two operators we need to see both operators
// 5) to know the result of an operation between two numbers we need to know both numbers
// These - I'll call them adjacency properties - mean that in at any given point we are only really looking at two adjacent
// number (separated by an operator) or two adjacent operators separated by numbers
// We aren't working with prefix or postfix notation where it's possible to have multiple adjacent numbers or operators

// So with that in mind, whenever we operate on at most two adjacent things and we need to know them and be able access them,
// a convenient data structure to use is a stack. We might need to reverse the order in which we do operations
// (relative to the order they show up in a string) so we use a stack for the operations

// Let's take an example to make this more clear a op2 b op1 c op3 d, and let's say prio(op3) > prio(op1) > prio(op2)
// We will create two stacks and iterate down the string, stack 1 for numbers, stack 2 for operators

// stack_nums = [a]
// stack_ops = []
// the first entity in the string is a number, push it onto stack nums

// stack_nums = [a]
// stack_ops = [op2]
// the second entity is an operator, push it onto stack 2

// stack_nums = [a, b]
// stacks_ops = [op2]
// push b onto the stack now we have enough entities to do a op1 b, but this might not be correct,
// since the b is involved in another operation that could be of higher precedence, so before we push this next operator
// onto the stack we need to check if it's higher or lower priority than our current operator at the top of the stack

// if prio(op2) > prio(op1) then we need to do op2 before op1, so we pop off the stack and do a op2 b,
// once we get this result we push it back onto the nums stack, since this composite number will be used in later calcs
// now we also push op1 onto the stack
// stack_nums = [a op2 b]
// stacks_ops = [op1]

// Then we just continue and push c onto stack_nums, and then attempt to push op3 onto stack_ops, but once again we must
// check prio(op1) > prio(op3), if it is we must do the op1 operation now, as it turns out it isn't so we push op3 on
// stack_nums = [a op2 b, c]
// stacks_ops = [op1, op3]

// then we push d onto stack nums, and we've hit the end of string
// stack_nums = [a op2 b, c, d]
// stacks_ops = [op1, op3]
// at which point we pop off stack_nums and stack_ops until both stacks are empty, so we do c op3 d
