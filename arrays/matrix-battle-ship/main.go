// This question is quite tricky if you don't know what to look for, the key lies in the hint that is given: that no two battleships are adjacent
// Rephrased, this means wherever you find a battleship, you are guaranteed to find only empty squares around it.
// If you do happen to find some squares that are together, then these must belong to the same battleship and should only be counted once together.
// So it suffices to find a single square to identify a battleship.

// One thing to note is that battle ships are either 1 * k or k * 1 in shape.
// So they are either horizonal or vertical lines, they can't take on more exotic shapes.
// This is useful since it tells us that a battleship square will have at most two neighbours, but it also tells us how to identiy them.

// Regarldess of whether you are k * 1 or 1 * k shape, there will always be one square, the first square, that is top most and leftmost.
// So if we can just identify this, then we've identified a battle ship. The key insight is that the ship will ALWAYS have no TOP or LEFT neighbours.
// So these squares are the ones we look for that we look for.
// This necessarily implies that all other battleship squares WILL have at least a top or a right neighbour.

// We could also use the bottom most and right most square with the condition that the square will have no right or bottom neighbours.
// But this is an unnatural choice since we iterate matrices from left to right, top to bottom.

// So our strategy will be to loop over the matrix once, and if we find an X that has no left or top neighbours, we increment a counter.
// Our time complexity can be no better than O(M*N) since we must visit every node at least once, as there is no way to know if an X is a new ship
// or if it belongs to an old ship without checking it. For each X we will perform at most 2 calculations to check if it's a ship head.
// We'll perform lookups against it's top and left neighbour, both can happen in O(1) since looking up elements in arrays by index is an O(1) operation.

// Now I think that Meta may ask an extended version of this question:

// Given a board return the orientation of the battleship.
// Then return, all the coordinates with a battleship given size of ship.
// Follow up: write a function to randomly place a battleship of size n on board.

// We can extend our solution quite simply. Once we find the head of the battleship (we modify the above code to return the coordinates), i.e. the left most.
// We call a helper function to check if it's a horizontal or vertical battleship by checking if it has a botton or right neighbour.
// Once we get the orientation. We call another helper function that takes a current (x,y) and checks if the next (x+1.y) or (x,y+1) is also there.
// Now apparently we might be able to assume ships of constant length, so this second function is not necessary.
// Once we get the start coordinates and orientation, we should easily imply the other coordinates.
